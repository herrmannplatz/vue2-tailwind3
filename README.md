# vue2-tailwind3

Simple showcase to demonstrate how to use [Tailwind CSS 3](https://tailwindcss.com) in [Vue.js 2](https://vuejs.org). The project uses the upcoming [Vue CLI version](https://next.cli.vuejs.org/migrations/migrate-from-v4.html), as this comes with [PostCSS 8.0](https://postcss.org/), which is a prerequisite for Tailwind CSS 3.
